# FileDateSorter
Sorts files by date and puts them in subdirectories by year and month

This project was designed to sort photos (mainly .JPG files) by year
and month.  It takes a source directory where a bunch of photos are 
mixed together and copies the photos in that directory to a series of
folders in the destination directory named by year and month under year.

If you want to sort more than JPG files there is an if statement in the
only for loop that can be changed to include more file types or not
to restrict any file types at all.
