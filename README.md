# FileDateSorter
Sorts files by date and puts them in subdirectories by year and month

This project was designed to sort photos (mainly .JPG files) by year
and month.  It takes a source directory where a bunch of photos are 
mixed together and copies the photos in that directory to a series of
folders in the destination directory named by year and month under year.
